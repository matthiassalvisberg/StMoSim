# StMoSim

Plots a QQ-Norm Plot with Several Gaussian Simulations.

With this package you can simulate several lines into the QQ-Norm Plot under the assumption of Gaussian distribution. If the realised observations lie inside of the simulations tracks there is the possibility that the observations stem from a Gaussian distribution. This can be very useful in residual analysis where you have to evaluate whether the model residuals fit the assumption of gaussian distributed terms or not.
